### Description ###
Javascript datepicker inspired  by Google material design. Simple and easy to
use the library. Just include the js and css file and use it. I've build this
to use with my current project and here I share the source code. This is build 
on plain javascript.

### Installation ###
Use bower to install the package or download zip and put it in your project. To use bower use below command :

`bower install -g material-datepicker`

### Dependencies ###
* font-awesome
* roboto-fontface (Optional) - This is only to give the datepicker more material look with the roboto font.

### Usage ###
Include these two css files in your page.

```html
<!-- REQUIRED -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/font-awesome/css/font-awesome.css">
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/material-datepicker/css/material-datepicker.css">

<!-- OPTIONAL -->
<link rel="stylesheet" href="bower_components/roboto-fontface/css/roboto-fontface.css">

<!-- REQUIRED -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="bower_components/material-datepicker/js/material-datepicker.js"></script>
```

Now that you already load all the required file, you can start using the datepicker anywhere in your code.

For example :
```javascript
var datepicker = new MaterialDatepicker(); // init
datepicker.show(); // show
// OR
datepicker.hide(); // hide
```

### Constructor ###
To construct simple datepicker, simply use `new MaterialDatepicker()`. But you can also provide option to the datepicker by passing the options to the constructor.

| Option Name | Data Type | Accepted Value       | Default Value | Required | Description                                                                         |
|-------------|-----------|----------------------|---------------|----------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| orientation | string    | landscape,portrait | landscape     | No       | Orientation for the datepicker                                              |
| debugMode   | boolean   | true,false         | false         | No       | Flag either to display the debug line in the console or not                         |
| closeOnBlur | boolean   | true,false         | true          | No       | Flag either to close the datepicker when user click outside the datepicker          |
| responsive  | boolean   | true,false         | false         | No       | Flag to enable responsive view for the datepicker.                          |
For example :
```javascript
var options = {
    orientation : 'landscape', // Show in landscape mode when viewing in wider screen
    debugMode : true, // show verbose log to the browser console
    closeOnBlur : true, // close when click outside datepicker
    responsive : true // enable responsive view for the datepicker
};
var datepicker = new MaterialDatepicker(options);
```

| md.after.show    | Event fire __after__ the dialog is visible.                                                                   |
| md.before.hide   | Event fire __before__ the dialog is hidden. (Note that this will also be call when cancel button is clicked.) |

    console.log("Before datepicker is shown...");
});

### Credit ###
The source code for this project is 100% by me but the design for the datepicker is copied from another material project because I need it in plain javascript and not with react.js. 

I refer to the datepicker in this project :- [Material-UI](http://www.material-ui.com)
